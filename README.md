## Features

- Automated code pull from GitHub.
- Static code analysis using SonarQube to ensure code quality.
- Builds a multi-stage Docker image for optimized deployment.
- Scans Docker images for critical vulnerabilities using Trivy.
- CI/CD pipeline managed with Jenkins, including Docker-in-Docker support.
- Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
- Sends build status notifications to a Slack channel.
